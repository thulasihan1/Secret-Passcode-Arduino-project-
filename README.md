# Secret-Passcode-Arduino-project-
The project contains 4 push buttons and they represent diffrent tasks for the project; lock mechanism, a "reset" mechanism, other two for the secret pincode. The servomotor at the start is in the unlock position(0 degrees) and the green LED is turned on(This is the unlock state). When you click the lock mechanism push putton the green LED is turned off while the Red Led is turned on and the servo motor is in the lock position(90 degrees) (This is the lock state). Now at the lock state, you use the other two pushbuttons for the secret pincode and to shift it back to the unlock position. Each time you click  the pincode push buttons the yellow LED will blink, indicating that you clicked that pushbutton. If the pincode that you put is incorrect, the Red LED will blink for 3 times and the device will remain in the Lock position. If you already know that you miss clicked a pincode pushbutton, you are able to use the reset mechanism push button(blinks a blue light when clicked) inorder to re-enter the secret pincode.
